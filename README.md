# CodeClause_Movie_Recommendation_System
# Description-->
In this Project of Movie Recommendation I have used datas of several Hindi & English Movies. I have selected only categorical features such as--> genre, description, cast and director of the movie as these are most important points required for recoomending a movie. Then I combine all this features and apply stemming on it, after by the help of vectorizer I have found 10000 most common words from all the tags and atlast using Cosine Similarity I got the result of 10 most similar movies that can be recommended for a selected movie.
