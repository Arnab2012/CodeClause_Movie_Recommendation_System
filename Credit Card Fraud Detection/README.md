# CodeClause_Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
# Description-->
This is my Task 1 as a Data Science Intern at Code Clause. In this Project of Credit Card Fraud Detection I have used dataset of some transactions over times by credit cards, in which some of the transactions are legit and some of them are fraud. As it is found that the dataset is highly imbalanced so I use under sampling to make the dataset balance. After that I split the dataset into train and test set and at first apply Logistic Regression to the data. After that I test my model with several different algorithms and at last found that the ExtraTreesClassifier algorithm giving the best accuracy and precision score for our model.
